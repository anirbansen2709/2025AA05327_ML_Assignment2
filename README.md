# Machine Learning Assignment 2

## 1. Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate six different classification algorithms to predict Default of Credit Card Clients using the UCI dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients). The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using multiple metrics, and deployment of the final solution as an interactive Streamlit web application.

## 2. Dataset Description
* **Dataset Name:** Default of Credit Card Clients dataset
* **Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients
* **Description:** The dataset consists of 15000 instances and 23 features. It includes attributes such as LIMIT_BAL, EDUCATION etc to classify samples into default yes/no categories.

## 3. Models Used & Evaluation Metrics
The following six machine learning models were implemented and evaluated. The performance metrics for each model are summarized below:

|           ML Model Name  |  Accuracy  |     AUC  |  Precision  |  Recall  |  F1 Score  |  MCC     |
|-------------------------:|-----------:|---------:|------------:|---------:|------------|----------|
|      Logistic Regression |   0.8117 | 0.7113 |    0.7933 | 0.8117 |   0.7751 | 0.3341 |
|            Decision Tree |   0.8187 | 0.7398 |    0.8004 | 0.8187 |   0.7986 | 0.3917 |
|                      kNN |   0.7923 | 0.6883 |    0.7689 | 0.7923 |   0.7742 | 0.3109 |
|              Naive Bayes |   0.3900 | 0.6670 |    0.7348 | 0.3900 |   0.3943 | 0.1193 |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) |   0.8033 | 0.7271 |    0.7799 | 0.8033 |   0.7815 | 0.3352 |
|       XGBoost (Ensemble) |   0.8073 | 0.7363 |    0.7873 | 0.8073 |   0.7902 | 0.3626 |

## 4. Observations on Model Performance
Below are the specific observations regarding how each model performed on the chosen dataset:

| ML Model Name            | Observation about model performance                                                                                                                                                                               |   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| Logistic Regression      | Strong Baseline: Achieved a solid 81.1% accuracy. While reliable for non-defaults, it had the lowest recall for defaults (0.25), indicating it struggles to identify risky clients compared to non-linear models. |   |
| Decision Tree            | Top Performer: Surprising leader in this run with the highest Accuracy (0.818) and AUC (0.740). It achieved a better balance for the minority class (Recall 0.37) than the linear baseline.                       |   |
| KNN Classifier           | Moderate: Performance was lower than tree-based models (AUC 0.688). This suggests that "closeness" in the feature space is not the strongest indicator of credit risk in this specific 23-feature dataset.        |   |
| Naive Bayes              | Poor Fit: The model failed significantly on accuracy (0.39) because it over-predicted defaults. While it had high recall (0.86), the extremely low precision makes it impractical for this use case.              |   |
| Random Forest (Ensemble) | Under-utilized: Performed slightly worse than the single Decision Tree. This is likely because it was restricted to only 10 estimators, which wasn't enough to leverage the power of the ensemble.                |   |
| XGBoost (Ensemble)       | Robust & Competitive: Delivered a strong AUC of 0.736. It matched the Decision Tree's recall (0.37) for defaults, showing it is effectively handling the complex relationships in the data.                       |   |
